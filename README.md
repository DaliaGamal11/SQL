# SQL
This repository is dedicated to exploring various SQL queries, their performance, and optimization techniques. By examining different query scenarios, we aim to improve how SQL queries are written for better performance in different database systems.

The project contains multiple .sql files, each focusing on specific SQL operations, such as:

Basic Queries: Select, Insert, Update, Delete
Advanced Queries: Joins, Subqueries, Aggregations
Best Practices: Writing efficient, clean, and maintainable SQL queries
